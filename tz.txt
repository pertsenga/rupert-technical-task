Technical Task
Task:
Integrate an external API into a Laravel project using GuzzleHttp and handle callbacks from this API.

Working with External API:
Using GuzzleHttp, make a GET request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts to retrieve a list of posts.
Make a POST request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts to create a new post with the fields title, body, userId.
Handling Callbacks:
Use the service Webhook.site to receive fake callbacks.

Implement a POST request handler on https://yourapp.com/callback to log the received data.

Example callback data: { "status": "success", "order_id": 12345 }


Logging and Security:
Log incoming and outgoing requests to the external API using Log::info().
Implement a check to ensure that the callback comes from a trusted source (e.g., check the IP address or token in the header).

Testing:
Write tests to verify the functionality of working with the external API and handling callbacks.

Expected Results:
Implement working with GuzzleHttp for API requests.
Handle incoming callbacks and log the data.
Write tests to verify the functionality.
